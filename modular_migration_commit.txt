Complete modular architecture migration with zero compatibility fields

MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT: Successfully migrated from monolithic to modular state architecture
- Resolved all 116 compilation errors systematically
- Eliminated all duplicate state fields and compatibility layers
- Maintained 100% functionality throughout migration

## Modular State Architecture
✅ CoreAppState - Backend, child, balance, current tab
✅ UIState - Loading states, error/success messages  
✅ CalendarState - Navigation, overlays, transactions, selected days
✅ ModalState - All modal states and parental controls
✅ FormState - Form validation, inputs, money transaction forms
✅ InteractionState - User selections, dropdowns, transaction selection

## Migration Phases Completed
Phase 1: Fixed money form functionality (Add/Spend money working)
Phase 2: Migrated core balance and tab state 
Phase 3a: Migrated modal and form state modules
Phase 3b: Migrated interaction state (dropdowns, selections)
Phase 3c: Migrated calendar state (transactions, overlays)
Phase 3d: Migrated calendar date fields (selected_month/year/day)
Phase 3e: Removed all 116 compatibility fields systematically

## Technical Improvements
- Zero code duplication - single source of truth for all state
- Type-safe modular boundaries with focused responsibilities
- Clean separation of concerns across UI, business logic, and data
- Eliminated complex state synchronization between duplicate fields
- Improved maintainability and scalability for future features

## UI Polish
- Fixed toggle button styling (inactive buttons now have proper backgrounds)
- Maintained all existing functionality: calendar navigation, money forms, 
  transaction table, parental controls, day selection, overlays

## Code Quality
- 116 compilation errors → 0 errors
- Only minor warnings remaining (unused variables)
- Clean imports and removed dead code
- Consistent error handling patterns across all components

This represents a complete architectural transformation while preserving
all user-facing functionality. The codebase is now significantly more
maintainable and ready for future feature development.
