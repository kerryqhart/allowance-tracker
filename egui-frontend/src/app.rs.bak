//! # App Module
//!
//! This module serves as the main entry point for the allowance tracker application,
//! re-exporting all UI components for easy access throughout the codebase.
//!
//! ## Purpose:
//! This module provides a clean, centralized import point for all UI functionality,
//! allowing other modules to simply `use crate::ui::*` to access all UI components.
//!
//! ## Usage:
//! Other modules can import everything they need with:
//! ```rust
//! use crate::ui::*;
//! ```
//!
//! This promotes code organization and reduces import boilerplate.

// Re-export all UI components for easy access
