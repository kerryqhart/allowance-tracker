feat(domain): add domain-level list & delete transaction operations

• Added `list_transactions_domain` and `delete_transactions_domain` to `TransactionService`, using the new `TransactionListQuery` and `DeleteTransactionsCommand` types.
• Existing DTO methods now delegate to the domain methods, preserving external API while advancing the migration off shared DTOs.
• Updated imports accordingly.

Part of the ongoing transactions migration described in shared-migration-plan.md.
