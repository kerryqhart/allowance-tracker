refactor(api): map transaction REST handlers to domain commands

• Replaced DTO-direct calls in `transaction_apis.rs` with domain-level commands/queries.
• Introduced `ListTransactionsQueryParams` to avoid name collision.
• Added mapping with `TransactionMapper` to convert between domain models and shared DTOs.

This removes remaining shared DTO usage from the transaction REST layer as part of the migration.
