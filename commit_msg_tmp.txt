refactor(api): migrate money management endpoints to domain commands

• `money_management_apis.rs` now constructs `CreateTransactionCommand` and calls `create_transaction_domain`.
• Uses `TransactionMapper` to convert domain Transaction back to DTO.

This completes REST-layer migration off shared DTOs for transaction creation pathways.
