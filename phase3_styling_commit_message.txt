✅ Phase 3: Styling Unification - Merge styling.rs and theme.rs into unified system

## What was accomplished:
- **Created unified styling module** under `ui/components/styling/` with 3 focused submodules:
  - `theme.rs` - Core theme structures and definitions (Theme, InteractiveColors, etc.)
  - `colors.rs` - Convenient access to most commonly used colors
  - `functions.rs` - Drawing utility functions (setup_kid_friendly_style, draw_card_container, etc.)
  - `mod.rs` - Main coordination and re-exports

## Unification improvements:
- **Eliminated duplication** between the old `styling.rs` and `theme.rs` modules
- **Merged color constants** from both modules into a single organized system
- **Combined structured theme approach** with practical utility functions
- **Organized color groups** by usage (interactive, layout, typography, calendar, table)
- **Maintained backward compatibility** with legacy color constants

## Technical details:
- Removed old `styling.rs` and `theme.rs` files (replaced by unified system)
- Updated all import statements across the codebase to use unified paths
- Preserved all existing functionality while improving organization
- Created convenient re-exports for the most commonly used items

## Module structure:
```
styling/
├── mod.rs           # Main module with re-exports
├── theme.rs         # Core theme structures 
├── colors.rs        # Color constants for easy access
└── functions.rs     # Drawing utility functions
```

## Validation:
- ✅ Compilation successful with unified styling structure
- ✅ App runs correctly with new styling imports
- ✅ All styling functionality preserved
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing styling API
- ✅ Improved organization and eliminated duplication

This completes the styling unification and prepares for Phase 4 (Component
Standardization). The scattered styling concerns have been unified into a
cohesive, well-organized system that eliminates duplication and provides
better maintainability.
