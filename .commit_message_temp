Fix chart view not refreshing when switching children

- Add load_chart_data() calls to all child change handlers
- Chart now refreshes alongside calendar and table views when switching children
- Fixes issue where chart would show stale data from previous child
- Chart refresh added to: header dropdown, child selector modal, and initial load

The chart view was the only component missing refresh logic when children changed,
causing it to display outdated data while other views updated correctly.
