feat: Add allowance indicators on calendar with future-only display

- Created new `use_allowance` hook to fetch allowance configuration from backend API
- Modified calendar component to display allowance chips on matching days of the week
- Added future date filtering - allowance indicators only appear on future dates
- Replaced blue circles with green dashed chips showing actual allowance amounts
- Chips use same color scheme as income transactions but with dashed borders to distinguish from real transactions
- Added hover effects and tooltips showing "Weekly allowance: $X.XX"
- Integrated with existing calendar transaction display system

Technical changes:
- Added `js-sys` dependency for date calculations
- Created `frontend/src/hooks/use_allowance.rs` with allowance state management
- Updated calendar props to accept allowance configuration
- Added CSS styling for `.allowance-chip` with dashed green borders
- Modified `main.rs` to use allowance hook and pass data to calendar

The allowance chips now appear alongside transaction chips in the day view,
making it easy to see when allowance is scheduled to be given in the future.
