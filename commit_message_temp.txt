Fix calendar navigation and add current day highlighting

- Fix calendar initialization to use system clock instead of hardcoded June 2025
- Calendar now properly opens to current month/year on startup
- Fix calendar navigation buttons to work correctly without reverting
- Add light pink outline (2px #ffc0cb) with subtle glow to highlight current day
- Current day highlighting works in both normal and delete modes

This resolves the calendar navigation issues where buttons weren't working
and the calendar was stuck on June 2025. The calendar now properly tracks
the current date and allows smooth month-to-month navigation.
