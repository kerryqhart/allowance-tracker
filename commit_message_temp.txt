feat: Implement comprehensive allowance configuration system

Add complete backend support for allowance management with database persistence,
business logic validation, and RESTful API access.

## New Features
- AllowanceConfig struct with day-of-week scheduling (0-6 mapping to Sun-Sat)
- GET /api/allowance - retrieve allowance config for active child
- POST /api/allowance - create/update allowance configuration
- Database table with proper constraints and foreign key relationships
- Comprehensive validation (day range, amount limits, data integrity)

## Architecture Components
- **Shared Types**: AllowanceConfig, request/response DTOs with helper methods
- **Database Layer**: AllowanceRepository with CRUD operations and indexes
- **Domain Layer**: AllowanceService with business logic and validation
- **REST API Layer**: Allowance endpoints with proper error handling

## Database Schema
- allowance_configs table with constraints: unique child_id, day_of_week (0-6)
- Foreign key to children table with CASCADE delete
- Indexes for child_id lookup and active config filtering

## Testing
- 15 comprehensive unit tests for AllowanceService covering all scenarios
- 4 API endpoint tests for proper HTTP behavior
- All 121 tests pass (112 backend + 9 shared)

## Implementation Details
- Amount validation: non-negative, max 1M limit
- Day validation: 0-6 range with helper methods for day names
- Default child selection when no child_id specified
- Proper error handling with anyhow integration
- Follows existing codebase patterns and architecture

Ready for frontend integration via REST APIs.
