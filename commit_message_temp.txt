Fix calendar navigation and add current day highlighting

- Fix calendar initialization to use system clock instead of hardcoded June 2025
- Calendar now properly opens to current month/year on startup
- Fix calendar navigation buttons to work correctly without reverting
- Add light pink outline (2px #ffc0cb) with subtle glow to highlight current day
- Current day highlighting works in both normal and delete modes

This resolves the calendar navigation issues where buttons weren't working
and the calendar was stuck on June 2025. The calendar now properly tracks
the current date and allows smooth month-to-month navigation. 

Remove fallback mock data logic from production transaction service

- Remove fallback to mock data when database is empty in list_transactions()
- Move generate_mock_transactions() and apply_cursor_filter() to test-only scope using #[cfg(test)]
- Update documentation to remove references to mock data support in production
- Fix test_list_transactions_with_cursor to create real database transactions instead of relying on fallback
- Preserve comprehensive mock data functionality for testing scenarios

This ensures production code only uses real database data while maintaining full test coverage through test-only mock utilities. The system is now clearer about its production vs. test behavior.

All tests passing (112/112) and application builds successfully.
