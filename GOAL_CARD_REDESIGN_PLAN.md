# Goal Card Redesign Plan

## Overview
Redesign the goal card to show comprehensive progress tracking through three distinct visual sections:

1. **Top Section (1/3 height)**: Full-width primary progress bar
2. **Bottom-Left (2/3 width, 2/3 height)**: Balance progression graph since goal creation  
3. **Bottom-Right (1/3 width, 2/3 height)**: Circular days tracker (donut chart)

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Goal Card Architecture
- **File**: `egui-frontend/src/ui/components/goal_renderer.rs`
- **Layout**: `egui-frontend/src/ui/components/goal_progress_bar/layout.rs`
- **State**: `egui-frontend/src/ui/state/goal_state.rs`
- **Current Layout**: Single column with title, summary, progress bar, completion info

### Existing Chart Infrastructure (To Reuse)
- **File**: `egui-frontend/src/ui/components/chart_renderer.rs`
- **Key Components**: `ChartDataPoint`, `prepare_chart_data()`, egui_plot integration
- **Data Flow**: Transaction fetching → DTO conversion → Chart point generation

## Implementation Plan

- **Memory Safety**: Zero unsafe code, leveraging Rust's guarantees

### Visual Impact

The new design provides **three complementary views** of goal progress:
1. **Linear Progress** (top bar): Immediate understanding of completion percentage
2. **Historical Context** (graph): How balance progressed over time toward the goal
3. **Timeline Awareness** (circular): Understanding of time investment and remaining duration

This **tri-perspective approach** gives users a comprehensive understanding of their goal progress that was impossible with the single progress bar design.

### Ready for Use
