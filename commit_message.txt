feat: Complete Goal Bounded Context migration from shared to domain models

MAJOR MILESTONE: Successfully migrated goal functionality to use domain models exclusively

Domain Architecture:
- Added goal module to commands.rs with comprehensive command/result types
- CreateGoalCommand, UpdateGoalCommand, GetCurrentGoalCommand, CancelGoalCommand, GetGoalHistoryCommand
- All commands return domain results with proper business logic encapsulation

Service Layer Refactoring:
- Refactored goal_service.rs to use domain models only (DomainGoal, DomainGoalState)
- Implemented bidirectional mapping: Storage (shared) ↔ Domain ↔ API (shared DTOs)
- All 5 public methods now use domain commands instead of shared DTOs
- Enhanced goal calculation and validation logic in domain layer

API Integration:
- Updated Tauri commands in lib.rs to use domain commands and goal mapper
- Fixed REST endpoints in goal_apis.rs with proper DTO conversion
- Updated all goal-related endpoints: GET /current, POST /, PUT /, DELETE /, GET /history
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing API contracts

Enhanced Components:
- GoalMapper now provides comprehensive response conversion methods
- Test suite completely migrated to use domain commands
- Fixed transaction service integration in goal calculations
- All 4 test methods updated to use domain types and commands

Benefits Achieved:
- Clean separation of concerns between domain, storage, and API layers
- Domain logic is completely independent of external contracts
- Type safety prevents shared types from leaking into domain
- Enhanced maintainability and testability
- Foundation ready for remaining bounded context migrations

Migration Progress:
✅ Domain Models Foundation
✅ Goal Mapper Creation  
✅ Goal Domain Model Fix
✅ Transaction Bounded Context Migration
✅ Allowance Bounded Context Migration
✅ Goal Bounded Context Migration ← COMPLETED
⏳ Next: Child Context Verification

Build verification: All compilation errors resolved, only warnings remain.
Runtime verification: Logs show goal service working correctly with domain commands.
