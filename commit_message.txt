refactor(transaction): Migrate transaction context to domain models

This commit continues the migration from shared DTOs to internal domain models, focusing on the "Transaction" bounded context.

Key changes:
- Created `Transaction` and `TransactionType` domain models in `src-tauri/src/backend/domain/models/transaction.rs`.
- Implemented `TransactionMapper` to convert between domain models and shared DTOs.
- Refactored `TransactionService` to use the new domain models for all internal logic, only converting to DTOs at the boundary.
- Updated the `TransactionStorage` trait to use `DomainTransaction`.
- Refactored the `CsvTransactionRepository` to implement the updated trait and use the domain model.
- Deleted the entire `sqlite` storage module and its references to simplify the codebase, as it was unused.

This completes the second major phase of the domain model refactoring plan.
