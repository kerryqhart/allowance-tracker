refactor: Eliminate UI cache for current child and improve allowance config

MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES:
• Remove dual sources of truth for current child selection
• Eliminate UI cache (self.core.current_child) that could get stale
• Use backend ChildService.get_active_child() as single source of truth
• Update all child references to use get_current_child_from_backend()

ALLOWANCE CONFIGURATION FIXES:
• Fix allowance modal updating wrong child due to cache inconsistency
• Add surgical debugging to trace child ID flow through modal
• Fix floating-point precision bug in amount change detection
• Change amount comparison from diff >= 0.01 to current_amount != orig
• Add missing load_allowance_config_for_modal() implementation

DEBUGGING & LOG IMPROVEMENTS:
• Add targeted child ID debugging for modal load and submit operations
• Reduce verbose frame-by-frame logs that cluttered console output
• Comment out repetitive APP UPDATE and FRONTEND CONVERT DEBUG logs
• Add strategic info logs for child switching and modal interactions

FILES MODIFIED:
• egui-frontend/src/ui/app_state.rs - Add get_current_child_from_backend()
• egui-frontend/src/ui/components/header.rs - Remove UI cache updates
• egui-frontend/src/ui/components/settings/allowance_config_modal.rs - Fix child ID flow
• egui-frontend/src/ui/components/settings/state.rs - Fix amount change detection
• egui-frontend/src/ui/app_coordinator.rs - Reduce log noise
• egui-frontend/src/ui/components/calendar_renderer/navigation.rs - Reduce log noise

BENEFITS:
• Single source of truth prevents child selection bugs
• Cleaner, more maintainable architecture
• Better debugging visibility for remaining issues
• Reduced console noise for faster development

This addresses the core issue where allowance config was updating
the wrong child due to UI cache being out of sync with backend state.
