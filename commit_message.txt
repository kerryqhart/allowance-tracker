refactor: Remove generic Connection types from domain services

Simplify domain layer by removing generic Connection type parameters
and using concrete CsvConnection throughout. This eliminates unnecessary
complexity since we only use CSV storage.

Changes:
- Remove <C: Connection> generics from BalanceService and TransactionService
- Update GoalService to use non-generic service dependencies  
- Simplify function signatures in export, calendar, and money management modules
- Remove unused Connection trait imports
- Update Backend struct to use concrete types
- Update all tests to use concrete types

Benefits:
- Cleaner, more readable code
- Reduced complexity and cognitive overhead
- Easier maintenance and debugging
- Single storage responsibility (CSV only)

All tests pass and compilation successful.
