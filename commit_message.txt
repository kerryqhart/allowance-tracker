Fix remaining warnings and doctest issues

Clean up all remaining code warnings and fix doctest compilation issues:

**Warning Cleanup:**
- Remove unused imports:
  - std::path::Path from child_service.rs
  - CreateChildCommand from allowance_service.rs
  - chrono::Utc from goal_service.rs
- Fix unused variables by prefixing with underscore:
  - _service and _service_default in export_service.rs
  - _dest_base in connection.rs
  - _original_dir in connection.rs
  - _transaction in transaction_repository.rs

**Doctest Fixes:**
- Fix file tree Unicode box characters by marking as text blocks
- Fix import paths in doctests to use allowance_tracker_egui
- Add proper function context for examples
- Add no_run attribute to prevent actual execution

Result: Zero warnings and all tests passing (unit tests and doctests).
