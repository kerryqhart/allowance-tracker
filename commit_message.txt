Fix calendar layout: proper grid display and dynamic week calculation

- Fix calendar days layout to display in proper 7-column rows instead of single row
- Implement dynamic week calculation - only show weeks needed for current month
- Remove unnecessary extra rows (e.g., August days when viewing July)
- Add proper spacing between day cells and week rows for visual consistency
- Deprecate egui::Grid approach in favor of manual layout for future flexibility
- Fix type conversion issues (i32 â†” usize) in calendar calculations
- Use chunks(7) iterator for clean row-by-row day rendering
- Remove dead code and unused variables

Calendar now properly displays with responsive grid layout and no extra rows.
Future enhancements like variable row heights are now possible with manual approach.
