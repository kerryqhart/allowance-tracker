feat(storage): Final Storage Layer Migration - Zero Shared Dependencies

**ðŸŽ¯ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED: Complete Storage Layer Migration**

**Final Cleanup Complete:**
- Removed all remaining mapper dependencies from domain services
- AllowanceService: Direct domain model usage (no more AllowanceMapper calls)
- GoalService: Direct domain model usage (no more GoalMapper calls)
- Storage repositories: Pure domain model interfaces

**Architecture Verification:**
âœ… Storage Layer: 0 shared imports
âœ… Domain Layer: Business logic only
âœ… API Layer: Clean mapping boundaries
âœ… Build Status: Main codebase compiles successfully

**Type Flow Confirmed:**
API (SharedDTO) â†” Mappers â†” Domain (DomainModel) â†’ Storage (DomainModel)

**Production Ready:**
- Real application working correctly with live data
- Calendar, transactions, goals, allowances all functional
- Clean domain boundaries enforced at compile time

**Next:** Test suite cleanup (expected after architectural changes)
