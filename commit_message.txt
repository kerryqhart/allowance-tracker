Reduce excessive logging by changing frequent info logs to debug level

The issue was that several frequently-called methods were logging at info level:
- get_child_directory() logged redirect messages on every call
- discover_children() logged child count on every call  
- get_active_child() logged on every call
- Found active child logged on every call

These methods are called multiple times per HTTP request due to:
1. Multiple services calling get_active_child()
2. Each get_active_child() triggering discover_children()
3. discover_children() calling get_child_directory() for each child
4. Other repository operations also calling get_child_directory()

This created a cascade of dozens of log messages for each frontend request.

Fixed by changing log level from info! to debug! for:
- "Child X data redirected to" message in get_child_directory()
- "Discovered N children" message in discover_children()  
- "Getting active child" message in get_active_child()
- "Found active child" message in get_active_child()

Now these debug messages are only visible when debug logging is enabled,
but normal operations will have much cleaner logs.
