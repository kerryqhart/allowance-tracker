Fix Tauri build error: Simplify crate structure to binary-only

- Remove mixed library+binary configuration from Cargo.toml that was causing 
  "crate `tauri` required to be available in rlib format" error
- Consolidate all code from lib.rs into main.rs for simpler project structure
- Update binary configuration to use standard Tauri app layout
- Remove unused lib.rs file
- Fix test function calls to match actual initialize_backend() signature

This resolves the build compilation error and adopts a more standard 
Tauri project structure. Application functionality remains unchanged.

Build now completes successfully with only warnings (no errors).
