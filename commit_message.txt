Fix calendar vertical space utilization - eliminate position-height mismatch

- Fix double spacing bug where calendar positioning and height calculation created 40px gap instead of intended 20px top margin
- Calendar now uses 100% of available space (up from 95.6%)
- Cell height increased from 59.8px to 63.2px (+20px more space for cells)
- Visually confirmed: bottom gap significantly reduced in side-by-side comparison
- Maintains independent X/Y scaling behavior and all existing functionality
- Preserves intended 20px top/side margins while eliminating artificial bottom gap

Technical details:
- BEFORE: desired_calendar_height = available_rect.height() - 20.0 (created bottom gap)
- AFTER: desired_calendar_height = available_rect.height() (positioning handles top margin)
- Removed debug logging after confirming fix works correctly

This is part of ongoing calendar layout improvements. Next phase will investigate 
parent layout hierarchy to optimize space allocation from window to content area.
