Implement working hover effects for transaction table using egui Button approach

✅ SUCCESS: Transaction row hover effects now working perfectly!

SOLUTION: Replace complex manual overlay system with egui's built-in Button hover:
- Each row is now a transparent egui::Button with built-in hover detection
- Cell backgrounds become more opaque when row is hovered (55 → 120 alpha)
- Content drawn on top of button using ui.allocate_ui_at_rect()
- Maintains exact same visual appearance and spacing as before

BENEFITS:
- ✅ Works with egui's layout system instead of fighting it  
- ✅ Handles scrolling, resizing, and layout changes automatically
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code (no manual calculations or debug logs)
- ✅ Leverages framework's native hover detection system
- ✅ Resilient and extensible for future table features

This was the right approach - working WITH the framework rather than against it.
