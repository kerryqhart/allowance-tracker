feat(domain): Complete Parental Control Bounded Context Migration

**Domain Architecture:**
- Migrated parental_control_service.rs to use domain commands exclusively
- Added ValidateParentalControlCommand and ValidateParentalControlResult
- Removed all shared DTO dependencies from domain service layer

**Service Layer Refactoring:**
- Updated ParentalControlService::validate_answer() to use domain commands
- Maintained all existing functionality with domain types
- Preserved test coverage for all validation scenarios

**API Integration Updates:**
- Tauri Commands: Updated validate_parental_control() with bidirectional mapping
- REST API: Updated validate_parental_control_answer() with proper conversion
- Both APIs handle: SharedRequest → DomainCommand → DomainResult → SharedResponse

**Test Coverage:**
- All parental control service tests updated to use domain commands
- Maintained coverage for correct/incorrect answers, case sensitivity, whitespace handling
- All validation scenarios continue to pass

**Migration Progress:**
✅ Allowance Bounded Context
✅ Goal Bounded Context  
✅ Child Bounded Context
