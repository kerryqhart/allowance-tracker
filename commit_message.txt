feat: Add automatic periodic allowance refresh capability

- Add refresh timing state to UIState with Instant/Duration for throttling
- Implement refresh_allowances() method that checks for pending allowances
- Integrate refresh call into main egui update loop (every 1 minute)
- Automatically reload calendar data when allowances are issued
- Add comprehensive tests for timing logic
- Include detailed documentation explaining the approach

The refresh feature allows the app to automatically issue pending allowances
without requiring a restart, using a throttled timing approach to prevent
excessive CPU usage. The calendar view updates immediately when new
allowances are issued.

Timing Strategy:
- Use Instant::now() to track when last check was performed
- Use Duration to define refresh interval (1 minute for testing)
- Only check allowances when enough time has passed
- Prevents checking every frame while keeping app responsive

Benefits:
- Automatic operation - no user intervention required
- Efficient - only checks when needed, not every frame
- Configurable - easy to adjust refresh interval
- Non-blocking - doesn't freeze UI during checks
- Reliable - uses system time, not frame-dependent
