Improve Add Money modal text fields: styling, width, and character limit

- Fix text field visibility by setting extreme_bg_color for egui 0.28 compatibility
- Widen description field from 350px to 400px for better text visibility  
- Increase character limit from 64 to 70 characters with updated validation
- Adjust warning threshold to 56 characters (80% of new limit)
- Update character counter display to show "X/70"

These changes make the Add Money form more user-friendly with visible
text inputs and more room for descriptive transaction entries.
