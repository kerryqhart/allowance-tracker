Clean up dead code and unused imports

- Remove unused imports from app.rs and components/mod.rs
- Fix unused variable 'grid_start_pos' in app_implementation.rs
- Remove dead code methods that are never called:
  * render_tab_buttons
  * draw_calendar_section_with_tabs
  * draw_transactions_section_with_tabs
  * draw_unified_content_card
  * render_calendar_section
  * render_transactions_section
  * render_money_management_section

Reduces compiler warnings and improves code maintainability.
Build verified to pass successfully after cleanup.
