Make git approval requirement more explicit in .cursorrules

Updated the git section to be much more prominent and clear about requiring user approval:
- Changed section header to "Git - REQUIRES USER APPROVAL"
- Added bold "CRITICAL" and "ALWAYS ASK" warnings
- Made it explicit to ask "Would you like me to commit these changes?"
- Expanded to cover ALL git operations (commit, push, merge, rebase, etc.)
- Added "If unsure, ASK FIRST" safety net

This should prevent AI from making commits without explicit user approval.
