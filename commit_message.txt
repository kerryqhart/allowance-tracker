feat(frontend): Refresh calendar data on new transaction

The calendar view now correctly updates when a new transaction is added via the "Add Money" or "Spend Money" forms.

This was achieved by creating a unified `refresh_all_data` callback in the main `App` component that refreshes both the transaction list and the calendar data. This callback is now passed to the money management forms.
