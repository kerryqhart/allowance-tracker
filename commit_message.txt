Phase 1: Fix z-index issue and add form fields to Add Money modal

- Replace egui::Window with egui::Area using egui::Order::Foreground
- Add proper layering with full-screen semi-transparent backdrop
- Implement description and amount input fields for Add Money overlay
- Add form field clearing on cancel/backdrop click
- Remove problematic render_add_money_modal() method
- Enhanced modal styling with consistent spacing and sizing
- Added auto-focus on description field when modal opens

This resolves the z-index issue where the modal appeared behind glyphs
and provides the foundation for Phase 2 (validation) and Phase 3 (backend integration).

The modal now properly appears above all other UI elements and includes
working form fields ready for validation and backend integration.
