Refactor calendar rendering to use CalendarDay components

- Add CalendarDay struct with state fields (day_number, date, is_today, transactions, balance)
- Create factory method create_calendar_days() to convert transaction data to CalendarDay instances
- Replace draw_calendar_days_responsive() to use CalendarDay.render() method
- Reduce procedural rendering code from ~136 lines to ~35 lines
- Maintain same visual appearance and functionality
- Improve code organization and maintainability

Phase 1 of calendar component refactoring complete - responsive rendering path now uses components.
