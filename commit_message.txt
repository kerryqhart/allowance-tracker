feat: Add future allowance chips to calendar view

- Add `list_transactions_for_calendar()` method to TransactionService domain layer
- Add CalendarTransactionsQuery and CalendarTransactionsResult command structs
- Simplify calendar REST API to make single domain service call (1:1 mapping)
- Fix future allowance chips not showing by moving orchestration logic to domain layer

The calendar now properly displays future allowance transactions alongside historical ones.
Calendar API now follows proper architecture with REST API mapping 1:1 to domain methods.

Logs show calendar generating 2 future allowances for July 18th and 25th (Fridays) 
along with 8 historical transactions, totaling 10 transactions for calendar display.
