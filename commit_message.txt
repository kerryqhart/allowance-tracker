Enhance calendar day expansion with precise sizing and collapse button

Features:
- Replace 2x height with precise calculation based on chip count
- Add collapse button with "^" symbol at bottom of expanded days
- Improved expand/collapse interaction flow
- Dynamic row height calculation using actual transaction count
- Better user experience with clear visual feedback

Technical changes:
- Calculate exact height: header + chips + collapse button + padding
- Add COLLAPSE_CLICKED handling alongside ELLIPSIS_CLICKED
- Enhanced tooltip system for expand ("...") and collapse ("^") actions
- Maintain responsive design principles with proper spacing

This creates a much more polished and intuitive calendar expansion system
that scales properly with transaction count and provides clear interaction cues.
