Fix goal completion detection and improve styling

- Add goal completion checking after transaction creation
  * Integrate GoalService.check_and_complete_goals() into MoneyManagementService
  * Goals now automatically complete when target amount is reached
  * Fixes issue where completed goals remained in "Active" state

- Update goal completion visual styling
  * Change progress bar completion color from lime-green to pink theme
  * Increase celebration text font size (20px->24px, 18px->22px)
  * Maintain consistent pink color scheme throughout UI

- Simplify goal completion headers
  * Remove overwhelming "You did it!" and "All done!" celebration headers
  * Keep clean, minimal completion state with just progress bar celebration
  * Preserve "Are you getting closer?" and "Days until..." for active goals

- Add comprehensive test coverage
  * Include failing test case reproducing the original issue
  * Verify goal completion triggers correctly via MoneyManagementService
  * Test follows TDD approach with systematic debugging

The goal completion flow now works end-to-end: transaction -> completion check -> 
UI update with elegant pink styling and appropriate celebration level.
