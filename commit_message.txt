Fix settings dropdown hover bug with screen-aware positioning

This commit resolves a critical UI bug where the settings dropdown would
close unexpectedly when hovering over menu items, while the child selector
dropdown worked perfectly.

## Root Cause
The settings menu positioned at the far-right edge (x=994) triggered egui's
automatic screen boundary adjustment, causing a mismatch between:
- Visual content (Frame): correctly shifted left to stay on-screen
- Interaction area (Area): remained at original off-screen coordinates

## Changes Made

### 1. Unique Area IDs (Best Practice)
- Modified DropdownMenu to accept unique identifiers
- Prevents Area ID collisions between different dropdown instances
- child_dropdown: "child_dropdown", settings_dropdown: "settings_dropdown"

### 2. Screen-Aware Positioning Fix
- Pre-calculate safe dropdown positions to avoid boundary adjustments
- Right-align dropdown when it would overflow screen width
- Eliminates visual/interaction area mismatches

### 3. Improved Button Rendering
- Replaced egui::Button with manual text rendering
- Eliminates any potential text selection interference
- Consistent with menu item rendering approach

### 4. Enhanced Debug Logging
- Added detailed hover detection logging
- Helps diagnose positioning and interaction issues
- Logs screen bounds, dropdown bounds, and mouse coordinates

## Technical Details
```rust
// Old: Fixed positioning that could go off-screen
.fixed_pos(dropdown_pos)

// New: Screen-aware positioning with right-alignment fallback
if button_rect.left() + estimated_dropdown_width > screen_rect.max.x {
    button_rect.right() - estimated_dropdown_width  // Right-align
} else {
    button_rect.left()  // Standard left-align
}
```

## Results
- Settings dropdown stays open when hovering over all menu items
- Both child selector and settings dropdowns work identically
- No more horizontal "dead zone" causing unexpected dropdown closure
- Improved code maintainability with unique IDs and debug logging

Fixes interaction bug where settings menu would close when mouse reached
specific horizontal coordinates, regardless of menu item being hovered.
