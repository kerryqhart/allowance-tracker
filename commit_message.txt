feat: implement independent calendar scaling in X and Y dimensions

- Break coupling chain that forced proportional scaling
- Replace width-based height calculation with space-based approach  
- Use absolute limits instead of proportional ones
- Calendar cells now scale independently when window is resized

Fixes locked aspect ratio behavior where horizontal stretch 
forced proportional vertical scaling.

Technical changes:
- Calculate cell_height from available vertical space, not cell_width
- Use fixed header_height (30px) instead of proportional
- Calculate card_height from component usage, not arbitrary values
- Replace proportional limits (.max(width*0.6)) with absolute limits (.max(40.0))

Root cause: Multiple coupling points created cascade effect where
horizontal changes forced proportional vertical changes.
