fix(tests): Major Test Suite Cleanup - Storage & Domain Layer Migrations

**âœ… COMPLETED MIGRATIONS:**
- Storage Layer: All repository tests now use DomainChild instead of shared::Child  
- Child Service: All tests migrated to use domain commands (CreateChildCommand, UpdateChildCommand, etc.)
- Result Access: Fixed all tests to access nested result structures (.child, .children, .active_child)

**ðŸ”§ TEST INFRASTRUCTURE FIXES:**
- AllowanceRepository tests: Use DomainChild with proper chrono::NaiveDate
- ParentalControlRepository tests: Domain model integration
- GlobalConfigRepository tests: Domain Child creation patterns  
- GoalRepository tests: Complete domain model adoption
- ChildService tests: Domain command patterns throughout

**âš¡ ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION:**
- Main codebase: âœ… Compiles successfully (warnings only)
- Storage Layer: âœ… Zero shared dependencies  
- Domain Layer: âœ… Pure business logic
- API Boundaries: âœ… Clean mapping patterns

**ðŸš§ REMAINING TEST WORK:**
- Update DbConnection â†’ CsvConnection in service tests
- Fix service constructor patterns for new dependencies
- Convert remaining shared DTOs to domain commands in API tests

**Impact:** Test suite errors reduced from 126 to manageable subset. Core architecture migration complete and validated.
