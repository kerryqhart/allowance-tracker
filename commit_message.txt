feat: Add automatic allowance issuing system

- Add automatic allowance checking and issuing logic to prevent missed allowances
- New AllowanceService methods:
  - get_pending_allowance_dates(): Identifies dates needing allowances
  - has_allowance_for_date(): Prevents duplicate allowances with robust detection
  - is_allowance_day(): Utility to check if date matches allowance schedule
- Integrate allowance checking into TransactionService.list_transactions()
- Add comprehensive unit tests for allowance checking logic
- Fix race condition that caused duplicate allowances by improving detection
- Logs show system correctly identifies existing allowances and prevents duplicates

The system now automatically issues allowances when:
1. Today matches the configured allowance day of week
2. No existing allowance transaction exists for that date
3. Child has an active allowance configuration

This ensures allowances are never missed when the app is used on allowance day.
