Polish collapse button with drawn triangle and remove tooltip

Improvements:
- Replace Unicode triangle symbol with programmatically drawn triangle
- Remove "Click to collapse" tooltip for cleaner interaction
- Fix font compatibility issues (Unicode symbol rendered as square)
- Use egui painter for reliable cross-platform triangle rendering
- Maintain perfect alignment with calendar day borders

Technical changes:
- Draw triangle using egui::Shape::convex_polygon for consistent rendering
- 8px triangle size with medium gray color for visibility
- Remove tooltip hover text for minimalist UX
- Font-independent geometric drawing instead of character dependency

The collapse button now renders consistently across all systems with a
clean, professional triangle indicator and minimal interface.
