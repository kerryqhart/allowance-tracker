feat: Implement export data functionality in settings system

## Overview
Adds comprehensive export data modal to the settings system, allowing users to export transaction data to CSV files with flexible location options.

## New Features
- **Export Data Modal**: Complete modal interface with form validation and backend integration
- **Location Options**: Choice between default Documents folder or custom directory path
- **Real-time Preview**: Dynamic filename and path preview updates as user makes selections
- **Backend Integration**: Full integration with ExportService::export_to_path() API
- **Form Validation**: Proper error handling and user feedback throughout the flow

## Technical Implementation

### Settings State Extension (state.rs)
- Added `ExportType` enum for Default/Custom location selection
- Created `ExportFormState` with comprehensive form management:
  - Export type selection (default vs custom)
  - Custom path input and validation
  - Real-time filename and preview generation
  - Loading states and success/error messaging
  - Form reset and clear functionality
- Integrated export state into main `SettingsState` structure

### Export Modal Implementation (export_modal.rs)
- Built complete export modal UI following established patterns:
  - Radio button selection for export location type
  - Conditional custom path input field
  - Real-time preview showing complete export path and filename
  - Action buttons with proper loading states
- Backend integration with `ExportToPathRequest`/`ExportToPathResponse`
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Modal backdrop handling and form reset on close

### Module Integration
- Updated settings module structure (`settings/mod.rs`)
- Added export modal to modal coordinator (`modals/shared/mod.rs`)
- Updated settings action handler in `app_state.rs` to open export modal

### UI/UX Improvements
- Clean, consistent styling matching other settings modals
- Professional appearance using text labels instead of emoji
- Intuitive workflow with immediate visual feedback
- Proper form validation and error messaging

## File Changes
- **New**: `egui-frontend/src/ui/components/settings/export_modal.rs`
- **Modified**: `egui-frontend/src/ui/components/settings/state.rs`
- **Modified**: `egui-frontend/src/ui/components/settings/mod.rs`
- **Modified**: `egui-frontend/src/ui/components/modals/shared/mod.rs`

## Testing Notes
- ✅ Compiles successfully with no warnings
- ✅ Export modal opens from settings menu
- ✅ Form validation and preview work correctly
- ✅ Backend integration functional
- ✅ Modal behavior consistent with other modals

## Future Enhancements
- Native file dialog support (rfd) for folder selection
- Path validation and directory existence checking
- Progress indicators for large exports
- Export format options beyond CSV

This implementation follows established patterns from the create child and profile modals, ensuring consistency and maintainability across the settings system.
