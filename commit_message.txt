Remove debug UI success messages

- Removed success_message field from UIState
- Removed success message rendering from header
- Cleaned up all success message usages throughout UI components
- Eliminates green "debug-looking" messages that appeared after transactions
- UI now provides cleaner user experience without persistent notifications

This removes the debug UI feature entirely as requested, making the
interface cleaner by eliminating the success messages that were
appearing when adding money or using delete functionality.
