Fix modal timing bug for edge calendar days

- Add modal_just_opened flag to prevent same-frame backdrop detection
- Edge calendar days (top/bottom rows, left/right columns) now work properly
- Prevents click event that opens modal from immediately closing it
- Flag resets after one frame to restore normal backdrop click behavior

Resolves the "brief flicker and immediate disappearance" issue where
clicking +$ buttons on edge calendar positions would fail to keep
the Add Money modal open due to backdrop click detection timing.
