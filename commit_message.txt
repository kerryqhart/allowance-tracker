- **Visual Feedback**: Selected transactions are highlighted with red border and scale effect

## Bug Fixes
- **Calendar Refresh Issue**: Fixed stale closure problem in calendar refresh callback
  - Updated `use_callback` dependencies to include `calendar_state`
  - Calendar now properly refreshes after add money, spend money, and delete operations
  - Eliminated need for manual month navigation to see updated transactions

## Technical Changes
- Enhanced `SimpleCalendar` component with delete mode props and selection handling
- Added delete mode state management in main app component
- Fixed callback dependency issues that prevented proper calendar updates
