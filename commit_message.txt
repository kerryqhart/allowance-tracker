Remove duplicate csv-prefixed repository files

Clean up old csv-prefixed repository files that were replaced by their
non-prefixed versions:

- csv_allowance_repository.rs → allowance_repository.rs
- csv_child_repository.rs → child_repository.rs
- csv_parental_control_repository.rs → parental_control_repository.rs
- csv_transaction_repository.rs → transaction_repository.rs
- csv_goal_repository.rs → goal_repository.rs

These files were leftover from the repository refactoring and are no
longer needed as their functionality has been moved to the non-prefixed
versions.
