Fix calendar grid alignment with navigation buttons

- Changed calendar layout from center to left alignment
- Removed internal spacing that was pushing calendar too far right  
- Removed card padding calculation that was making calendar 30px narrower
- Calendar grid now perfectly aligns with navigation buttons
- Equal 20px margins on both left and right sides

The calendar now has a clean, professional appearance with consistent
left alignment and balanced margins throughout the interface.
