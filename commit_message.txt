fix: Resolve calendar balance bug using TDD approach

Root Cause:
- UI layer was hardcoding all transaction timestamps to 12:00:00
- Same-day transactions had identical timestamps causing unstable sorting
- Backend used wrong transaction balance instead of final daily balance

TDD Investigation:
- Used systematic bottom-up layer testing approach
- Added debug logs to trace data flow through frontend/backend
- Identified UI timestamp creation as the culprit layer

Fix Applied:
- Replace hardcoded noon (12:00:00) with current time
- Use chrono::Local::now() for hour/minute/second precision
- Ensures unique timestamps for same-day transactions

Result:
- July 21st now shows correct final balance ($19.62 not $18.62)
- Backend balance calculation working correctly
- Chronological transaction ordering preserved
