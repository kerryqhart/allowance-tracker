Refactor: Move header functions to separate module

- Created egui-frontend/src/ui/components/header.rs with 3 functions:
  - render_header()
  - render_child_dropdown() 
  - render_messages()
- Updated components/mod.rs to include header module
- Removed functions from app_implementation.rs
- Fixed compilation error with allocate_ui_with_layout usage
- Reduced app_implementation.rs from 1946 to 1607 lines (339 lines moved)
- Zero implementation changes - functions moved exactly as-is
- All functionality preserved with proper module structure
