Implement unified content card with integrated toggles

- Replace separate calendar and transactions sections with unified card approach
- Add toggle buttons inside card header for Calendar/Table view switching
- Implement draw_unified_content_card() with proper layout and styling
- Create draw_card_header_with_toggles() for integrated header controls
- Add conditional content rendering based on current_tab selection
- Fix calendar grid positioning and layout within unified card structure
- Maintain responsive design and proper spacing throughout
- Clean up unused methods and improve code organization

This matches the reference design with toggles integrated into the card header
rather than separate floating tabs above the content.
