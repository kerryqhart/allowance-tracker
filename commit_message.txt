feat(storage): Begin Storage Layer Migration to Domain Models

**Storage Traits Updated:**
- Migrated AllowanceStorage, ParentalControlStorage, and GoalStorage traits to use domain models
- Added DomainAllowanceConfig, DomainParentalControlAttempt, and DomainGoal imports
- Updated method signatures to use domain models instead of shared DTOs

**Domain Models Created:**
- Added ParentalControlAttempt domain model with business logic methods
- Updated domain models module to include parental_control_attempt

**Partial Repository Updates:**
- Updated AllowanceRepository to use DomainAllowanceConfig
- Fixed imports and method signatures for allowance storage

**Work in Progress:**
- Goal repository migration (needs type conversion updates)
- Parental control repository migration
- Domain service updates to handle new storage signatures
- Mapper updates for domain/shared conversions

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete goal repository migration
2. Update parental control repository
3. Fix domain service conversion issues
4. Update mappers for bidirectional conversion
5. Update all CSV repositories to use domain models

This is a systematic migration of the storage layer from shared DTOs to domain models, 
following the bounded context migration pattern established in previous commits.
