feat: implement dynamic calendar scaling with consistent margins

This commit fixes calendar layout issues to provide optimal space utilization
and consistent visual margins.

## Key Changes

### 1. Dynamic Row Calculation
- Calendar now detects whether a month needs 5 or 6 rows
- Cell height automatically adjusts to fill available space optimally
- July 2025 (35 days, 5 rows): larger cells, no wasted space
- August 2025 (37 days, 6 rows): optimal fit as before

### 2. Consistent Margin System  
- Fixed bottom margin to match 20px side margins
- Resolved double-subtraction bug that created uneven spacing
- All margins now consistent: 20px on all sides

### 3. Independent X/Y Scaling
- Calendar scales independently on horizontal and vertical axes
- Maintains aspect ratio constraints while maximizing space usage
- Responsive design works across different window sizes

### 4. Code Cleanup
- Removed debug logging and temporary investigation files
- Cleaned up unused variables and test artifacts
- Simplified calculation logic for maintainability

## Technical Details

- Uses `calendar_days_count` to calculate `rows_needed = ceil(days/7)`
- Dynamic `cell_height = available_space / rows_needed`
- Fixed container height: `available_height - 40px` (20px + 20px internal padding)
- Maintains 5px spacing between calendar elements

## Files Modified
- `egui-frontend/src/ui/components/calendar_renderer.rs`
- Removed: test investigation files and debug artifacts

## Result
Calendar now provides optimal space utilization with perfect visual consistency
across all calendar layouts, regardless of month length.
