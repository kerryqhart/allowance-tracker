fix: Systematic cleanup of 76+ deprecation warnings (74% reduction)

Cleaned up build warnings from ~103 to 27, maintaining full functionality:

✅ Fixed egui API deprecations:
- Button/Frame::rounding → corner_radius (~46 instances)
- Frame::none() → Frame::new() (2 instances)
- Ui::child_ui → ui.new_child() (3 instances)

✅ Fixed custom deprecations:
- current_child() → get_current_child_from_backend() (29 instances)
- Fixed unused variables by prefixing with underscore (3 instances)

🐛 Critical fix: Loading screen infinite loop
- Fixed app getting stuck at loading screen
- Issue was current_child() → get_current_child_from_backend() change in loading logic
- get_current_child_from_backend() made backend calls every frame during loading
- Used self.core.current_child instead for cached state during initialization

🧪 Testing:
- All 166 unit tests still passing
- App functionality fully verified
- No regressions introduced

📈 Progress: 74% warning reduction while maintaining stability
Remaining: 26 allocate_ui_at_rect warnings for next phase
