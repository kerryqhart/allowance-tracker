Fix table layout and spacing to match calendar

- Updated table to use 92% width with proper centering (matching calendar)
- Fixed layout structure that was causing rows to appear horizontally instead of vertically
- Replaced ui.horizontal() with ui.allocate_ui_with_layout() for proper vertical flow
- Adjusted card padding from 20.0 to 15.0 to match calendar spacing
- Ensured table rows now appear correctly below headers instead of offset to the side
- Maintained responsive column widths and gradient bubble headers
- Cleaned up unused variables

The table now has consistent spacing and layout behavior matching the calendar view.
