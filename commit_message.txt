fix: clean up compilation warnings

- Move profile configurations from egui-frontend to workspace root
- Remove unused `config` field from GoalProgressGraph struct  
- Remove unused `estimate_goal_completion_date` function
- Clean up related imports and constructor methods

All unit tests continue to pass. Build now compiles without warnings.
