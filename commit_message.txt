feat: Add floating tooltips to calendar chips and update future allowance descriptions

• Added smart floating tooltips that show transaction descriptions on hover
  - Professional styling with dark background, white text, and rounded corners
  - Intelligent boundary detection to prevent tooltips from going off-screen
  - High z-index layering to appear above all other UI elements
  - Only displays when transaction descriptions exist (not empty)

• Updated future allowance descriptions from "Weekly allowance" to "Upcoming allowance"
  - Changed in AllowanceService::generate_future_allowance_transactions()
  - Preserved "Weekly allowance" for historical allowances in TransactionService
  - Updated corresponding test cases
  - All 160 unit tests pass

The tooltip implementation provides immediate context about transactions without
cluttering the calendar interface, while the updated descriptions better
distinguish between historical and future allowances.
