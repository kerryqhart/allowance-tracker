✅ Phase 0: Implement Modular Architecture - Transform AllowanceTrackerApp to use focused state modules

## Major Achievement
Successfully transformed AllowanceTrackerApp from monolithic flat structure (782 lines) 
to clean modular architecture using focused state modules.

## New Modular Structure
```rust
pub struct AllowanceTrackerApp {
    // NEW: Modular state architecture
    pub core: CoreAppState,           // Backend, child, balance, tab
    pub ui: UIState,                  // Loading, messages
    pub calendar: CalendarState,      // Calendar navigation, overlays  
    pub modal: ModalState,            // All modal states
    pub form: FormState,              // Form validation, inputs
    pub interaction: InteractionState, // User selections, dropdowns
    
    // TEMPORARY: Backward compatibility fields during migration
    // ... 50+ compatibility fields to maintain existing UI components
}
```

## Key Improvements
- **Separation of Concerns**: State split into focused modules by responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Each module has clear boundaries and minimal dependencies
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing UI components continue to work unchanged
- **Migration Ready**: Foundation for systematic component-by-component migration

## Technical Implementation
- Eliminated duplicate enum definitions between app_state.rs and state modules
- Added getter/setter methods for seamless component transition
- Implemented state synchronization between modular and compatibility fields
- Maintained all existing functionality and behavior

## Verification
- ✅ Compilation: Success (warnings only, no errors)
- ✅ Runtime: App launches and responds to interactions correctly
- ✅ UI Integrity: Calendar selection, navigation, and modals working
- ✅ Ready for Phase 1: Header component migration

## Next Phase
Phase 1 will migrate header.rs to use new modular fields:
- `self.success_message` → `self.ui.success_message`
- `self.current_child` → `self.current_child()` method
- `self.backend` → `self.backend()` method

This establishes the foundation for systematic cleanup of the remaining 50+ components.
