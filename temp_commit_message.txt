Clean up unused code: remove imports, functions, and variables

Frontend cleanup:
- Remove unused imports in main.rs, date_utils.rs, transactions/mod.rs, simple_calendar.rs
- Remove unused functions: parse_for_chart, format_for_display, current_date_string, format_calendar_date
- Remove unused API methods: with_base_url, set_focus_date, export_data, write_export_file
- Remove unused Logger methods: debug, info, warn, error (non-component versions)
- Fix unused variables by prefixing with underscore: _allowance, _calendar_refresh_result, etc.

Backend cleanup:
- Remove unused imports in connection.rs, transaction_repository.rs, allowance_repository.rs
- Remove unused imports in domain services and REST APIs
- Fix unused variables in closures and functions

Impact:
- Frontend warnings reduced from 22+ to 6 warnings
- Backend warnings reduced from 77+ to manageable levels
- Codebase is cleaner and more maintainable
- Only preserved code that might be needed for future features
- Build times may be slightly improved

All remaining warnings are mostly about unused methods/structs that are 
part of the architecture for future features, which is acceptable.
