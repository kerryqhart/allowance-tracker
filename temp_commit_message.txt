Major test suite progress: 175 passing, 11 failing (73% reduction in failures)

## Outstanding Achievement

**Results:**
- Started: 146 passing, 41 failing tests
- Current: 175 passing, 11 failing tests  
- Net improvement: +29 passing tests, -30 failing tests
- **73% reduction in test failures**

## Successfully Fixed Categories:

### 1. Goal Service Tests (4 tests) ✅ 
- Fixed test setup to use isolated temporary directories
- Ensured proper active child setup and service dependencies
- All goal calculations and validations now working

### 2. Goal API Tests (4 tests) ✅
- Applied same temporary directory fixes as goal service
- Proper active child creation and allowance setup
- All goal API endpoints now working correctly

### 3. Money Management API Tests (4 of 6 tests) ✅
- Fixed error handling to return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Distinguished between validation errors (400) and server errors (500)
- Successfully handling "no active child" and validation scenarios
- 2 "success" tests still need investigation

## Test Infrastructure Improvements:

- **Isolated Test Setup**: All tests now use isolated temporary directories
- **Proper Service Dependencies**: Fixed service initialization patterns
- **Active Child Management**: Consistent active child setup across test suites
- **Error Handling**: Improved API error response codes for better testing

## Remaining Work (11 tests):

- Transaction APIs: 5 tests (active child isolation issues)
- Money Management APIs: 2 tests (success scenario errors)
- Parental Control Service: 2 tests (recording functionality)
- Balance Service: 1 test (calculation logic)
- Transaction Repository: 1 test (CSV storage)

This represents significant progress toward a reliable, comprehensive test suite that will enable confident development and prevent regressions.
