Fix subheader button alignment

- Updated toggle buttons height from 30px to 35px to match navigation buttons
- Improved vertical centering with proper layout alignment
- Both navigation controls and view toggles now consistently aligned

The Calendar/Table toggle buttons on the right now properly align with 
the month navigation arrows on the left, eliminating the visual 
misalignment that was caused by height differences.
