Fix unit test failures and clean up debug code

This commit resolves multiple test failures and improves the test suite reliability:

## Test Fixes

### 1. Parental Control Service Tests (2 tests fixed)
- **Issue**: `record_parental_control_attempt` and `get_parental_control_attempts` failing because service used "global" as child ID but repository couldn't find child with that ID
- **Fix**: Modified parental control repository to handle "global" as special case, creating direct "global" directory path instead of child lookup

### 2. Balance Service Test (1 test fixed)
- **Issue**: `test_recalculate_balances_from_date` failing with balance validation errors due to incorrect chronological processing
- **Root Cause**: `get_transactions_since` method wasn't returning transactions in chronological order, causing incorrect running balance calculations
- **Fix**: Added critical sort operation in `recalculate_balances_from_date`: `transactions.sort_by(|a, b| a.date.cmp(&b.date));`

## Code Cleanup

### Removed Debug Code
- Removed extensive `println!` debug statements from:
  - `balance_service.rs` (🔄 BALANCE DEBUG statements)
  - `transaction_repository.rs` (📖 READ DEBUG, 💾 WRITE DEBUG, 🔍 FIND DEBUG, 📁 CSV DEBUG statements)
- Cleaned up verbose debug logging in `compare_dates` and `find_child_id_for_transaction` methods
- Retained appropriate `info!` level logging for production use

### Impact
- **Test Results**: 11 → 8 failing tests (27% reduction)
- **Total Passing**: 178 tests (3 additional fixes)
- **Fixed Critical Bug**: Balance calculation logic now correctly handles backdated transactions
- **Improved**: Parental control data storage and retrieval

The balance calculation fix is particularly important as it ensures accurate financial tracking when backdated transactions are inserted.
