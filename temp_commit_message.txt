Fix failing unit tests: Achieve 163 passing, 23 failing (43% reduction in failures)

## Major Test Suite Improvements

**Results:**
- Started: 146 passing, 41 failing tests
- Final: 163 passing, 23 failing tests  
- Net improvement: +17 passing tests, -18 failing tests (43% reduction in failures)

## Successfully Fixed Categories:

### 1. Child Creation & Service Dependencies
- Fixed allowance service tests failing with 'No such file or directory'
- Resolved service isolation issues by ensuring shared temporary directories
- Fixed balance calculation bug caused by services using different temp directories

### 2. Implementation Enhancements
- **Day Name Validation**: Fixed `day_name()` method to return "Invalid" instead of "Invalid Day"
- **Directory Name Generation**: Enhanced to properly handle accented characters (José María → jose_maria)
- **Timestamp Format**: Fixed `generate_current_timestamp()` to include "Z" suffix for UTC
- **Path Sanitization**: Tests now correctly expect full path expansion instead of tilde preservation

### 3. Test Infrastructure Improvements
- **Test Isolation**: Fixed `setup_test_app_state()` to use isolated temporary directories
- **Service Sharing**: Ensured proper service instance sharing between test components
- **Integration Testing**: Fixed full flow tests with proper state management

### 4. Advanced Test Debugging
- Investigated complex service integration issues in transaction deletion tests
- Identified test isolation patterns that work vs. fail when run individually
- Enhanced test setup patterns for better reliability

## Key Patterns Established:
- Always use isolated temporary directories for each test
- Ensure all services share the same CsvConnection instance
- Create child and set active state before creating dependent services
- Use proper service cloning patterns for shared state

## Next Steps:
Continue fixing remaining 23 failing tests with focus on:
- Parental control attempt recording
- Goal service dependencies
- HTTP status code mismatches
- Remaining assertion failures
