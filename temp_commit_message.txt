Fix calendar selector horizontal offset issue

- Fixed CSS positioning for date picker calendar dropdown
- Changed desktop positioning from left:0/right:0 to centered with transform
- Added flex-direction: column to calendar-grid for proper layout
- Added on_debug prop to DatePicker component for debugging
- Updated forms to pass debug callback to DatePicker
- Removed problematic DOM measurement code causing compilation errors

The calendar dropdowns now properly center below their date picker buttons
instead of being horizontally offset to span the full form width.
