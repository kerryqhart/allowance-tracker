Fix data storage location and remove migration functionality

- Remove migration functionality from CSV connection (start fresh with data)
- Fix Tauri 2.x path API usage by using environment variables instead of non-existent tauri::path::document_dir()
- Remove incorrect "path-all" feature from Cargo.toml 
- Update DATA_LOCATION.md to remove migration references
- Data now stored in ~/Documents/Allowance Tracker for easy iCloud sync
- Add logging to show data directory location

The app now stores data in the user's Documents folder without trying to migrate old data, making it compatible with iCloud Drive sync when users enable "Desktop & Documents Folders" in iCloud settings.
